# AI-pingpong
A backup for project AI ping-pong android application, contributed by Windcome and Nablax in 2017. The project wasn't done yet.

## Overview
A tiny bluetooth sensor is attached to the ping pong racket. The app would recieve the trajectory of the racket via the sensor and analyze the movement of the racket with machine learning methods.

## Modules
+ Bluetooth module: to receive the trajectory data from the sensor.
+ Statistics module: to collect and visualize the data, for example, a histogram that counts everyday hits.
+ Replay module: to record the video, store the historical data, and replay.
+ 3D module: to visualize the trajectory with Opengl model.
+ AI module: to classify the trajectory data and provide professional suggestions(implemented with Python).

## murmur
The code is long and uneasy to read, but we did take effort on doing it, to learn the Android and develop this app at the same time. Though that period was tough, it was also evocative.
